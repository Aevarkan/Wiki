# Git

Git is one of those version control systems, and is also the most widespread. Systems aside from Git, of course, *do* exist.

You may have heard of *[GitHub](https://github.com)* before; however, it's important to recognise that *Git* and *GitHub* are <ins>not</ins> the same thing. GitHub is only *one* service that hosts Git.
