# An Introduction To Programming

I don't believe that reading a bunch of theory will help you learn programming; therefore, I have included only the very fundumental concepts for this section.

Wherever possible, I have provided examples in multiple programming languages in order to illustrate how concepts are often shared across languages. *Symbolic* means the example is in mathematical notation.

I will include a section at the bottom that goes into more detail; however, they should be viewed in *conjunction* with an example that you are working through.
