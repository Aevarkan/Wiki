# Variable
A variable, as hinted by its name, is something that can *vary*. More specifically, it is a value that you can set and, in most cases, change.

<Tabs groupId="syntax" queryString>
  <TabItem value="symbolic" label="Symbolic" default>
    $$
    \text{let}\; x = 5
    $$
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java
    int myVariable = 5;
    ```
    
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    
    ```javascript
    const myVariable = 5;
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    
    ```python
    my_variable = 5
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Ignore the words in front of the variable that appear in some examples for now. The core concept remains the same.
