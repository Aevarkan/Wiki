# Low Level
All the examples, until now, were in *high-level* programming languages. The **level** of a language refers to how far it abstracts away the internals of the computer, which is where all code runs in the end.

This section, hopefully, will challenge a few assumptions you thought were true about computers, but were actually abstractions created on top of them.

Before you go, there is one common misconception about computers that I must address:
> Computers **are not** *just* addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division machines. **Modern computers would not be possible with just 4 basic operations.**
