# Field

:::warning

A field in mathematics does not have the same definition as a field in physics!

:::

## You Learnt This!
In primary school, you would've been taught the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division $(+, -, \times, \div)$.

Subracting a number is the same as adding the negative of that number.

<Tabs groupId="syntax">
  <TabItem value="example" label="Example" default>
    $$
    10-5=10 + (-5) = 5
    $$
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="generic" label="General Case">
    $$
    a-b= a + (-b)
    $$
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Division is the same as multiplication by the reciprocal.

<Tabs groupId="syntax">
  <TabItem value="example" label="Example" default>
    $$
    25 \div 5 = 25 \times \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) = \frac{25}{5} = 5
    $$
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="generic" label="General Case">
    $$
    a \div b = a \times \left( \frac{1}{b} \right) = \frac{a}{b}
    $$
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Hence, we can say that there are only two elementary operations $(+, \times)$.

:::tip

You will want to get into the habit of using a dot for multiplication instead of a cross, meaning that you should write $(+,\, \cdot \;)$ instead of $(+, \times)$. This is to avoid confusion with the cross product!

## The Formal Definition
With that out of the way, let's formally define what a field is.

:::note

You may find that the formal definition of a field can differ slightly between authors; however, they all have the same meaning.

The standard real number line, as you know it, is a field: $\mathbb{F_{\mathbb{R}}}=(\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot)$.
