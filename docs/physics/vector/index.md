# Vector
Without a doubt, you are familiar with the concept of **scalars**. For example: 1, 2, $\sqrt{3}$, and $\pi$ are all examples of scalars. Scalars only have a *magnitude*; they don't have a direction.

A **vector**, on the other hand, has both *direction* and *magnitude*: **displacement**.

## Notation
As vectors have direction and magnitude, they cannot be described using just one number.

A common form is the column matrix:
$$
\mathbf{v}=\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
$$

To not confuse vectors with scalars, they need to be written differently. Arrow notation and **boldface** are the two most common methods to differentiate vectors from scalars, but are not the only methods.

$$
\mathbf{v}=\vec{v}=\underset{\sim}{v}
$$
